The talent is invoked by concentrating on the thought/emotion for (15 &ndash; SI) &times; 2 seconds</p><p>The target is specified at the time transmission is attempted; the target&rsquo;s location does not need to be known by the invoker. The intended target must have a minimum Aura of 11, and is usually someone the invoker knows quite well (EML is reduced by 10&ndash;50 if this is not the case). Someone who receives an emotion will feel it&mdash;this can have an interesting effect.</p><p>If a person with the Sensitivity talent is near the target or the invoker at the time of transmission, they may receive the transmission along with, or instead of, the intended target.</p><p><strong>Psionic Episodes</strong>: Sharing dreams is very common. Broadcast of thought or emotion to nearby people can also occur.</p><p><strong>Misfire (CF)</strong>: Sending a transmission to the wrong person, releasing the wrong thought and/or emotion, etc.</p>",
