    "description": "<p>A self-enchantment which creates a sphere of ethereal fire, two inches in diameter, in the caster’s hand. The caster cannot release the sphere. The fireball illuminates a spherical area, of radius CSI hexes, with orange/red, gently-flickering light. No seed fire or spark is required.</p><p>The sphere is primarily used as a light source, but it will inflict an ethereal burn of CSI+1d6 (MS) or CSI+2d6 (CS) if it touches a mundane or ethereal entity. Generated impact is a burn against ethereals, but a shock roll for mundane creatures. See note below</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><table><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML50+</td><td>Caster may terminate the enchantment by releasing the sphere.</td></tr><tr><td style='width: 4em;'>CML90+</td><td>Caster may throw (with throwing skill) the sphere up to CSI hexes. The sphere is a Low Velocity missile and may be dodged as such.</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: To a mundane creature, an Ethereal Burn is a Shock Roll: if the generated “Fire Impact” exceeds Endurance, the victim loses consciousness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI seconds</p><p>Range: Self/CSI hexes at CML90+</p><p>Duration: CSI rounds</p>",
