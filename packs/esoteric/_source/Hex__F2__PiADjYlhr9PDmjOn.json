    "description": "<p>Sometimes called &ldquo;the evil eye.&rdquo; Hex is the ability to &ldquo;curse&rdquo; a victim, causing them to have bad luck. If the invoker has a part of the victim (nail parings, lock of hair, etc.) increase EML by 20. Such items cannot be used more than once.</p><p>At the time the talent is invoked, the maximum distance between the invoker and the intended victim depends on whether the invoker has a part of the victim. If a part is available, the maximum distance is SI leagues. If a part is unavailable, the maximum distance is line of sight.</p><p>With MS, the victim&rsquo;s next attempt to use any skill, talent, spell, is made at half EML. With CS, halve the EML for all the victim&rsquo;s skills rolls for the next ML minutes (MS).</p><p>Psionic Episodes: The character and/or companions have unusual spells of good (or more likely bad) luck.</p><p>Misfire (CF): The invoker suffers the effect.</p>\n\n\n",
