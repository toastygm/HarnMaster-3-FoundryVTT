Within the cloud, visibility is zero, except the caster is unaffected.</p><p>The cloud drains energy from those it touches, inflicting Fatigue and causing a shock roll. For each round of exposure, a victim tests Endurance; the test-multiple depends on casting success and the victim’s Immersion. A victim whose mouth/nose are within the cloud for (most of) a round is Fully Immersed. This is determined by comparing the victim’s height with the depth of the Pall.</p><p>Pall demands concentration for Duration; the caster must remain still.
