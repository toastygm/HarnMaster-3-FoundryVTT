    "description": "<p>An enchantment to install a known spell in a major artifact. Store cannot install a spell in a minor artifact. A stored spells have a casting time less than one second and “fire” instantly on the caster’s normal turn.</p><p>Store must first be successfully cast, followed by a successful casting of the spell to be stored. The stored spell occupies one (1) point of Ego/Will per complexity level. That is, a stored VII spell occupies seven points of Ego/Will. Up to CSI spells may be stored in the same artifact, subject to the limits of Ego/Will and spell complexity. Each installation requires a separate casting of Store.</p><p>At the time of storing, the caster designates a key word or phrase to invoke the stored spell. Thereafter, the spell can be invoked by anyone speaking the command word/phrase. To cast a stored spell, the invoker must win or tie a Mental Conflict. See Skills 23/24. The time required for this Mental Conflict is negligible.</p><p>An invoked spell is no longer stored. A stored spell dissipates harmlessly when Duration expires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bonus Effects</h2><p>(none)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time: 15-CSI minutes</p><p>Range: Touch (to store)</p><p>Duration: CSI days</p>",
